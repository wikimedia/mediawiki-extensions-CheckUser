	 * array for each signal.

	 * @param UserIdentity $userIdentity The user that the signals should be matching against
	 * @param string $eventType The type of event occurring. One of the EVENT_* constants in
	 *   {@link SuggestedInvestigationsSignalMatchService}, though private code may trigger
	 *   custom event types. Used by hook handlers to exclude matching against events that
	 *   are not relevant for the hook.
	 * @param SuggestedInvestigationsSignalMatchResult[] &$signalMatchResults An array of
	 *   {@link SuggestedInvestigationsSignalMatchResult} objects used to indicate which signals matched and
	 *   which signals did not match. Hook handlers should add to this array if a signal was tested against
	 *   the user.
